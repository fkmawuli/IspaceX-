    To move around the filesystem, people use the cd command most often. However, to
move repeatedly among the same directories, you can use the pushd and popd com-
mands to work with a stack of directories.
        <br/>
Copying files is done with the cp command. However, the dd command can be used
to copy files (such as disk images) from a device (such as a CD-ROM drive). For creat-
ing directories, you can use the mkdir command.
        <br/>
Instead of keeping multiple copies of a file around on the filesystem, you can use
symbolic links and hard links to have multiple filenames point to the same file or
directory. Symbolic links can be anywhere in the filesystem, while hard links must
exist on the same partition that the original file is on.
        <br>
To search for files, Linux offers the locate and find commands. To verify the integ-
rity of files you download from the Internet, you can use the md5sum and sha1sum
commands.
